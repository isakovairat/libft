## Description
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes
you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.

## How does it work?
The main aim is to create a library called libft.a from the source files which I can use that library for my future projects at [21 school][1].
