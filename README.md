## Description
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes
you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.

## How does it work?
The main aim is to create a library called *libft.a* from the source files which I can use that library for my future projects at [21 school][1].
To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project and call **make**:

      git clone https://github.com/isakovairat/libft
      cd libft
      make

You will see a library *libft.a* file and some object files (.o).
So that's it!
